**Software engineer** with **7+ years** of experience developing web applications using **Angular** , **Typescript** , and **Python** under
**AWS** cloud infrastructure. Focused on creating robust software solutions developing high-quality and reusable code. I have
experience creating from small to big projects using tools like custom libraries and schematics in Angular, and serverless
lambda functions with Python. I am looking for an organization where I can contribute and impact with my experience.

### EXPERIENCE

**Airnguru
Full Stack Developer / Team leader** _— April, 2021 - Present_
● Led a cross-functional product team (2–4 engineers) across frontend, backend, and full-stack roles, driving
consistent delivery of high-impact features for key customer products.
● Mentored junior and semi-senior developers by conducting regular code reviews to maintain high-quality standards.
● Designed and implemented a flow to create and send notifications to the frontend when new data is added to the
database, using AppSync and DynamoDB Streams. Removing the problem that each tab of the application requested
data every minute asking for new data and causing usual bottlenecks.
● Created CloudFormation templates to replicate complete stacks across different customers and using different AWS
services.
● Implemented an external library in Angular and custom Angular directives to create our own dynamic slides creator,
reducing by 90% the time of our customers creating their financial PDFs.
● Developed a custom server-side PDF creator using Puppeteer, improving the accuracy, and quality of the PDFs, and
reducing the waiting time by 70%.
Tech Stack: Angular 11 to 18, Typescript, Python, Javascript, NodeJS, Puppeteer, AWS (Cognito, Amplify, S3, Lambda,
AppSync, DynamoDB, DynamoDB Streams, CloudFormation, Step Functions, SQS, EC2, CloudFront), GraphQL.
**Frontend Developer** _— May, 2020 - April, 2021_
● Developed a custom Angular library to reuse components, services, and directives through all other Angular projects
of the application, reducing the time of reimplementing features.
● Created a new web module, through Angular development consuming a REST API. Allowing to do custom queries
and show sorted results, managing a huge amount of data.
● Implemented an external library in Angular, through technical documentation analysis. Allowing to manage
information in an understandable and smart way.
● Integrated an external authentication service (AWS Cognito), allowing to guarantee the security of the authentication
and the requests made by the users.
Tech Stack: Angular 8 to 11, Typescript, Javascript, AWS (Cognito, Amplify, S3, Lambda, CloudFormation, DynamoDB).
**Nobilis, Frontend developer** _— July, 2018 - May, 2020_
● Added new features for the frontend working in Angular and the backend using NodeJS under an automatic testing
framework to measure the quality of the code in SonarQube. Very relevant to the company to guarantee a minimum
standard of the written code.
● Refactored application modules using Angular and NodeJS, achieving to improve the performance and avoid
application crashes.
Tech Stack: Angular 4 to 7, Typescript, Javascript, NodeJS, Loopback 2, MongoDB.
